# 🎯 Trojan Horse(TH) Simulator(Sim) — Ethical Malware Behavior Simulation in Python

A **disguised calculator app** built with PyQt6 that simulates Trojan horse malware behaviors for **ethical cybersecurity training** and education.  
Designed to mimic real-world Trojan tactics including beaconing, fake alerts, and ransomware file renaming — all harmless and fully controlled.

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a Trojan horse malware running stealthily behind a normal calculator GUI.  
It demonstrates concepts like:  
- Beaconing to a Command & Control (C2) server.  
- Simulated backdoor installation delay.  
- Distracting fake system alert popups.  
- Ransomware simulation by renaming dummy files with `.enc`.  
- Triggering beacons every second popup alert.  

**Why It Matters**  
Malware simulation tools help:  
- Train cybersecurity analysts on attacker behavior patterns.  
- Test detection and response processes in safe environments.  
- Educate on typical malware tactics without real risk.
